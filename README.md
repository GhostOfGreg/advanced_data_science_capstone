Advanced Data Science Capstone by IBM

About this Course:

This project completer has proven a deep understanding on massive parallel data processing, data exploration and visualization, advanced machine learning and deep learning and how to apply his knowledge in a real-world practical use case where he justifies architectural decisions, proves understanding the characteristics of different algorithms, frameworks and technologies and how they impact model performance and scalability.

Tasks:

First, you’ll identify a data source and use case for your project. Then, you’ll investigate your data set to know it better. You’ll also prepare it for downstream machine learning and deep learning.

After that, you’ll test different models, to maximise your model’s performance.

Finally, you’ll create a data product and the final presentation to stakeholders.
